# EventManagers

## Intro

Unity doesn't offer a built-in EventManger, it does thou offer UnityEvent - A generic argument persistent callback that can be saved with the Scene.
You can read more about them here:
https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Events.UnityEvent_2.html

If you want to see why you should use one then check this out:

There isn't one perfect EventManger, it dependes on the type of events your game uses.
Here I'll go through the differernt EventMangers added in this project.
